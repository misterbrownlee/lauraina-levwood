<h3 class=cushycms>News from Lauraina</h3>
<div class=cushycms>Hello, Bodywork Lovers! When you book your first bodywork session with me in 2012, choose from two of the following offerings:<br/>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The Scholar&#39;s Soother</strong> - revitalizing rosemary scalp massage</li>
<li>
<strong>The Pedestrian&#39;s Pleasure</strong> - peppermint foot reflexology</li>
</ul>
<p>
Remember to ask for the &quot;Soul-Care Special&quot; when booking your appointment, and specify which offering you prefer. For the scent-sensitive, both offerings can be done scent-free.<br/>
<br/>
As always, student rates and package deals are available. I look forward to being part of your New Year&#39;s resolution for more attentive self-care!<br/>
<br/>
In health,&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class=cushycms>About Lauraina</h3>
<div class=cushycms>I started down the trail of the birth world over nine years ago as a birth advocate and a student of midwifery. Eventually realizing that the medical study of birth was not my true path, I turned a corner in the labyrinth and found myself in the role of Postpartum Doula, supporting the dance of mother and baby. I spent the next four years of my life tending to families during the immediate postpartum time. During this time, as a witness to many beautiful families during their postpartum healing journeys, I slowly began to realize how deep of an imprint a birth can leave on everyone involved.&nbsp; It was because of this that I become a Birth Doula, in order to support women, babies, and their families through this important, impactful, and sacred rite of passage.<br/>
<br/>
My certifications include: Certified Massage Therapist, Certified Postpartum Doula, Certified Infant Massage Educator, Birthing From Within Mentor, and Birth Doula in training. Lauraina&#39;s education includes: the Boulder College of Massage Therapy; DONA International; Cornerstone Doulas; Birthing From Within; and The Farm with Ina May Gaskins. Lauraina also holds two Bachelors of Arts, in Dance and Interdisciplinary Philosophy/Creative Writing, from James Madison University.<br/>
<br/>
My bodywork practice is holistic, drawing from both a technical, western approach as well as from energy work and eastern therapies. I have a tender affection for mothers and babies, which led to my specializing in Prenatal, Postpartum, and Infant massage. I also feel a deep reverence and respect for the sacred feminine in all of us and love to support women through their lives&#39; journeys. Women in all phases of life use my practice as part of their monthly self-care ritual, creating a cyclical lunar rhythm for deep physical transformation and spiritual renewal.</div>
