	<h3>Birth Doula Care</h3>
	
      <p class="subheading">Facilitating greater health &amp; happiness, in birth and beyond!</p>
	<p>Giving birth to a new life is one of the most powerful experiences that you can have in this
		 world. The time before, during, and after this monumental occurrence is both sweet and 
		delicate. </p>
		
   	<div class="pullQuote rounded">
		"The postpartum massages were amazingly helpful in adjusting to the body stresses of being a new 
		mama. Lauraina does a great job of checking in and working with what's going on in the mind and body. 
		As a birth doula, her presence at our birth was exactly what we needed; 
		grounding, loving and supportive. As a postpartum doula, Lauraina did what needed to be 
		done and modeled loving, respectful interaction with my baby, from which I learned 
		a lot. You would be lucky to work with Lauraina."

	<p>Taking care of your body is more important than you have ever known, as well 
	as caring for the body of your new family. Your entire family community needs to be 
	watered, as it is the tree bearing the new fruit of your baby. Birth doula care is 
	a gift of loving care for yourself, your family, and your baby during 
	this cherished time.</p>

	<h3>What is Doula Care?</h3>
	 <p>A birth doula provides physical, emotional, and informational support for birthing women, 
		their partners, and their babies - before, during, and after labor. As your birth doula 
		I will be a positive support for you during your entrance into parenthood.</p>

		 <p>I will be your advocate and your guide, providing educational resources and attentive listening 
		skills so that you are fully informed and confident about your birth choices. I bring 
		the heart of a healer and the skills of a bodyworker to the doula role, and will 
		hold sacred, healing space for you and your entire family throughout the journey 
		of your birth.</p>
